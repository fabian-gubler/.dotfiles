Hi,

I'm an avid Emacs fanboy, but I've hit a wall that Emacs can't solve but I believe Neovim can. However, I would like some input from the community about Neovim before making a commitment to switchover.

I essentially have four workflows that require a PDE, and Emacs is perfect for 3 out of 4 of them. I want to know how would I handle these in Neovim.

Reading and taking notes. In Emacs this usually involves me having a split screen with a PDF or webpage on oneside and a file to take notes in on the other.

Discussing reading. This involves me often having three Emacs windows or buffer open. A file to take some notes during the discussion, my file on my reading notes, and the reading itself.

Working on personal coding projects, which involves quickly jumpping between open buffers and different files.

My day job, which essentially requires me to use VSCode and as a result makes my Emacs config pointless for 8 hours a day. I know Neovim has a VSCode plugin, which would resolve that problem.

My question is essentially, how would you integrate Neovim into a workflow around reading and note taking? I've tended to not love the GUIs for Neovim (though the last time I tried one was maybe 4 years ago) but tmux is also a lot to configure alongside Neovim just to get the functionality I've had with Emacs almost since day 1
